# NAFHAM Landing Page with motion graphics(lottie.js)
in this project i built a multi-section landing page, i used js(ES6) to ADD ANIMATIONS AND MOTION GRAPHICS. I also designed a custom fixed navigation bar, added a Q&A that's only visible when the user open the answer tab, and created a responsive layout to use across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
